I have added new features to the game like now:
- That the sheep spawn at three different points so the user will have to move from right to left in order to kill them.
- A heart, which each time a sheep is killed by the user leaves the dead sheep and it rotates and decreases its size.
- Sound effects, when every time we shoot, when a sheep is killed by a shot or when a sheep drops.
- I have added a marker, which counts every time a sheep is killed or falls off the map, once the marker reaches "x" number of sheep drops, the game is lost also the game finish and the user go to the main screen.
- I have added a main screen before entering the game in which you can choose the machine of the color that the user wants to play by clicking on the machine and two buttons where one of them will be to play and the other one to be able to leave.
